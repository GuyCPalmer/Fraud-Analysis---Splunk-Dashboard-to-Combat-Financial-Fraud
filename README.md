<h1>Fraud-Analysis---Splunk-Dashboard-to-Combat-Financial-Fraud</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>

In the "Fraud Analysis - Creating a Splunk Dashboard to Combat Financial Fraud" project, I designed a comprehensive Splunk dashboard tailored to simulate real-world financial data and scenarios. This project was driven by my passion for data-driven solutions in cybersecurity. The enterprise version of Splunk allowed me to construct a dashboard that monitors transactional integrity across various demographics and transaction categories. Through this process, I honed key skills in data processing, from query formulation to dynamic visualization. I gained hands-on experience with Splunk and data analysis (especially in the context of cybersecurity). I also developed skills in interpreting data fields and identifying key insights, as well as presenting complex data in an accessible format. This project solidified my proficiency with Splunk and data analysis, transforming raw data into a fortress of defense. 

Here is what I did to create this project...
